## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Cities
Update `src/services/realEstateDataIngestion.ts`:
```typescript
private builderDatabase = {
  ...existingCities,
  'YourNewCity': ['Builder1', 'Builder2', 'Builder3']
};
```

### Customizing Recommendation Scoring
Modify the scoring algorithm in `src/services/intelligentRecommendationEngine.ts`:
```typescript
private calculateIntelligentScores(listings: any[], userIntent: UserIntent, city: string): Promise<EnhancedRecommendation[]> {
  // Customize scoring weights
  const overall = Math.round(
    (builderCredibility * 0.25 +     // Builder trust
     locationTrend * 0.25 +          // Location growth
     priceValue * 0.20 +             // Price efficiency
     userAlignment * 0.20 +          // User preferences
     projectPopularity * 0.10) * 10  // Market popularity
  ) / 10;
}
```

### Adding New Data Sources
Update `src/services/realEstateDataIngestion.ts`:
```typescript
private async ingestFromSource(
  source: 'Housing.com' | '99acres.com' | 'MagicBricks.com' | 'NoBroker.in' | 'YourNewSource',
  config: IngestionConfig
): Promise<PropertyListing[]> {
  // Add your new source logic
}
```

### Customizing Smart Filters
The Smart Filter system is preserved exactly as-is. To extend it, modify `src/components/SmartFilterPanel.tsx`:
```typescript
// Add new filter categories while preserving existing logic
const newFilterCategory = {
  ...existingCities,
  newCategory: ['Option1', 'Option2', 'Option3']
}
```

### Theme Customization
Update BrickMatrix™ theme in `src/styles/brickMatrixTheme.css` (preserved):
```css
:root {
  --bm-primary-purple: #6A0DAD;
  --bm-electric-violet: #8F00FF;
  --bm-gradient-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, #000000 0%, #4B0082 100%);
}
```
